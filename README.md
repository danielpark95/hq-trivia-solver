## NLP
***Named Entity Recognition:***  
>Question = "Which of these agencies began as the North West Police Agency?"  
>NER Output = {"North West Police Agency" - organization}.  

***Open Information Extraction:***   
>Question = "In which college class would you be most likely to study a syzygy?"  
>OpenIE Output = {"you" /subj, "study" /relation, "syzygy" /obj}  

***Grammatical Dependencies:***  
>Dependencies = -> likely/JJ (root)  
>  -> class/NN (nmod)  
>    -> In/IN (case)  
>    -> which/WDT (det)  
>    -> college/NN (compound)  
>  -> would/MD (aux)  
>  -> you/PRP (nsubj)  
>  -> be/VB (cop)  
>  -> most/RBS (advmod)  
>  -> study/VB (xcomp)  
>    -> to/TO (mark)  
>    -> syzygy/NN (dobj)  
>      -> a/DT (det)  
>  -> ?/. (punct)  

***Syntactic Parses:***  
>Parse tree = (ROOT (SBARQ (WHPP (IN In) (WHNP (WDT which) (NN college) (NN class))) (SQ (MD would) (NP (PRP you)) (VP (VB be) (ADJP (RBS most) (JJ likely) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB study) (NP (DT a) (NN syzygy)))))))) (. ?)))
