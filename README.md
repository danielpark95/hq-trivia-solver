## NLP
Named Entity Recognition:
Question = "Which of these agencies began as the North West Police Agency?"
NER Output = {"North West Police Agency" - organization}.

Open Information Extraction:
Question = "In which college class would you be most likely to study a syzygy?"
OpenIE Output = {"you" /subj, "study" /relation, "syzygy" /obj}

Open IE returns subject entity "you" with relation "study" and object entity "syzygy". We choose either the subject or object entity (the one that doesn't have which / what / how / where / etc) and use it as a feature for our model.

Grammatical Dependencies:
Dependencies = -> likely/JJ (root)  
  -> class/NN (nmod)  
    -> In/IN (case)  
    -> which/WDT (det)  
    -> college/NN (compound)  
  -> would/MD (aux)  
  -> you/PRP (nsubj)  
  -> be/VB (cop)  
  -> most/RBS (advmod)  
  -> study/VB (xcomp)  
    -> to/TO (mark)  
    -> syzygy/NN (dobj)  
      -> a/DT (det)  
  -> ?/. (punct)  

Syntactic Parses:
Parse tree = (ROOT (SBARQ (WHPP (IN In) (WHNP (WDT which) (NN college) (NN class))) (SQ (MD would) (NP (PRP you)) (VP (VB be) (ADJP (RBS most) (JJ likely) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB study) (NP (DT a) (NN syzygy)))))))) (. ?)))
